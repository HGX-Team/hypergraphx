⚙️ Installation
========================================

You can install HGX using pip:

.. code:: bash

   pip install hypergraphx

.. note::

   If you are using notebooks, install the docs requirements too to enable rich outputs.

To install from source:

.. code:: bash

   pip install -e .

Optional dependencies
---------------------

If you only need core functionality, the base install is enough. For docs or notebooks:

.. code:: bash

   pip install .[docs]

For development tools:

.. code:: bash

   pip install .[dev]
