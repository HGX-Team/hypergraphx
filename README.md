**Hypergraphx** (HGX) is a Python library for the analysis of real-world complex systems with **group interactions**. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools to construct, visualize, and analyze **hypergraphs** with weighted, directed, temporal, and multiplex interactions. HGX aims to provide, as a single source, a wide range of tools for higher‑order data: conversions across representations, measures of higher‑order organization, filtering and sparsification, generative models, and dynamical processes from contagion to synchronization. The framework is general and designed to be user‑friendly and accessible.

## 🌐 What are higher-order networks?

Networks capture pairwise (dyadic) interactions. But many real systems involve groups of three or more units acting together: cellular networks, drug recombination, brain networks, face‑to‑face interactions, collaboration teams. Hypergraphs model these **higher‑order interactions** directly, with hyperedges that connect any number of nodes.

## ✨ Why HGX

HGX brings together tools to build, store, analyze, and visualize higher‑order systems in a single framework. It supports weighted, directed, temporal, signed, and multiplex hypergraphs and provides methods for measures, filtering, modeling, and dynamics. Beyond experts in the field, the goal is to make higher‑order network analysis accessible to anyone working with relational data.

## 🚀 Quick start

### Install

```bash
pip install hypergraphx
```

Latest (from GitHub):

```bash
pip install hypergraphx@git+https://github.com/HGX-Team/hypergraphx
```

### Create a hypergraph

```python
from hypergraphx import Hypergraph

H = Hypergraph(edge_list=[(1, 2, 3), (2, 4)])
print(H.num_nodes(), H.num_edges())
print(H.get_neighbors(2))
```

### Add weights and metadata

```python
H = Hypergraph(
    edge_list=[("A", "B"), ("B", "C")],
    weighted=True,
    weights=[1.2, 0.7],
    node_metadata={"A": {"role": "source"}},
    edge_metadata=[{"type": "interaction"}, {"type": "interaction"}],
)

print(H.get_weight(("A", "B")))
print(H.get_node_metadata("A"))
```

### Convert and analyze

```python
line_graph = H.to_line_graph()
print(line_graph.number_of_nodes())
```

### Temporal interactions (at a glance)

```python
from hypergraphx import TemporalHypergraph

T = TemporalHypergraph()
T.add_edge(("A", "B"), time=1)
T.add_edge(("A", "B", "C"), time=2)
print(T.get_edges(time_window=(1, 3)))
```

## 🧰 Library highlights

- **Representations and transforms**: hypergraphs, bipartite networks, line graphs, clique expansions, duals.
- **Measures and statistics**: degrees, correlations, assortativity, motifs, and mesoscale structure.
- **Centrality and motifs**: spectral approaches, shortest paths, betweenness flows, motif sampling.
- **Communities and inference**: hard and overlapping communities, assortative/disassortative structure.
- **Filtering**: statistically validated hypergraphs and significant interacting groups.
- **Generative models**: Erdos-Renyi, scale-free, configuration, community-based, temporal activity-driven.
- **Dynamics**: synchronization, social contagion, random walks, diffusion.
- **Rich semantics**: weighted, directed, temporal, multiplex, signed interactions.
